# DPProject

Our job is to design a Visual Programming Environment Framework.

A programmer should be able to add a VPE to their application.

We need to design two applications, from different domains, that demonstrate
the use of our framework.

# Keep in mind:
"Framework needs to provide a graphical representation of concepts defined in the application" - Dave

# Questions to address:
What do users see?
What can users do?
What would be a good way to programmatically describe the elements of a program?
How are the elements of a visual program connected to the host application?
How are the visual programs execute?
How are the visual programs debugged?
